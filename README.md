My AWS Cloud Computing journey

So I have decided to go on a one-man AWS labs journey of learning everything I can possibly learn in AWS cloud computing

I'm staring in March 2023 and I hope I'm able to complete all the AWS SAA modules by the end of April because I would love to take the certification exam by then.
